# W5_Travel_Bucket_list_project

This is my first project using Ruby, SQL, Sinatra to make a web app for a user.
this app has the capability to show the added list of cities by the user and give him the option to add new countries and cities and specify which city has already visited and which to be visited.
to open the app you should first create a data base on your computer with name 'travel_list' and then from the commmand lines run the sql file inside the db folder with the data base using psql command, and then run seeds.rb file from the same folder.
and then run the app.rb file which is the main route .
finally open your browser and type localhost:4567/ and enjoy ;)
